# INSIGHTS

## Key Points
- Mobile users drop a lot after the "Interact" step → product pages on phones may not be clear enough. Show discounts or delivery info earlier.  
- Many users click but don’t buy → could be due to surprise costs, checkout being too long, or trust issues.  
- Lots of chat intents are "unknown" or "help" → users seem confused. Better chatbot replies or quick answers may reduce this.  
- Intents like "discount" and "delivery" link closely with purchases → highlight these more on the site.  

## Suggested Experiment
Run an A/B test on mobile product pages:  
- **Version A:** current page.  
- **Version B:** show discount and delivery time at the very top.  

**Metric to track:** conversion from **Clicks → Purchase**.  
If Version B lifts conversion even slightly (+5%), roll it out to all mobile users.
